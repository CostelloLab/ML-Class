# ML-Class
Repository for code and data from the machine learning class in spring 2023. 


## Git workflow

1. Create a new branch and name it with the feature you are working on (e.g., “mod1_lg”)
2. Push code updates (i.e., “commits”) to the new branch, not main
3. Create a pull request to merge the new branch with the main branch
4. 2 people will review the code in the pull request, and approve or comment on the pull request
5. After 2 approvals, merge the pull request into the main branch
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for the next feature
